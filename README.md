## üö© Why Apemaster Office

ApeMaster Office Assistant is a third-generation WebOffice document control. It is currently the only commercial document control on the market capable of achieving embedded web operation in the latest browsers like Chrome. It is a boon for OA, ERP, and other systems handling various documents. Having been released and refined for over 3 years, it has made significant progress in both functionality and stability.

## üé® Core advantage

Compared to other WebOffice document controls on the market, its core advantages mainly include the following points:

1.Relying on exclusive patented technology, it achieves the embedding of Office software windows within web pages in the latest browsers, enabling the best integrated user experience when integrating with business systems;

2.In addition to providing the OLE embedding mode like other WebOffice controls, it uniquely provides a complete embedding mode, supporting functions like document comparison, suitable for scenarios with lower requirements for document security;

3.Compatible with simultaneous installation and use of Microsoft Office and Kingsoft WPS (requires Microsoft Office 64-bit version installed). Microsoft Office Home, Education editions, and WPS Personal edition are also usable, requiring VBA support installation;

4.Does not rely on any browser plugins or extension interfaces. Browser upgrades will not cause system shutdown risks. Communication adopts the HTML5 international standard WebSocket, enabling bidirectional real-time communication;

5.Simple installation and configuration, no need for additional browser configuration or system modification. The startup process has no pop-up windows, unlike some WebOffice controls that require confirmation pop-ups during startup. Moreover, the launched window is independent, unable to integrate with the business system's web page, providing an excellent experience;

6.Provides direct transmission of document data byte streams to open and save documents. Provides a document security mode under OLE embedding mode, maximizing the security of document data;

7.Empowered by ApeMaster Middleware, it enables fully imperceptible online upgrades of the document control, automatic startup on boot. Additionally, it provides a controllable calling mode for the document control, further enhancing the security of the system and document data;

8.If necessary, customers can purchase the source code of the Office web component to achieve source code-level autonomy and custom function development;

## üíù Compatible Code

Apemaster Office is a pure front-end solution. There's no need to consider whether the back-end code is in JAVA or .NET, nor whether the web server system is Windows or Linux. Simply install Apemaster Office on the client computer, and the JavaScript calling interface of the web front-end page can be easily integrated into your project.

## üåê Compatible Browsers

Apemaster Office not only supports the latest versions of browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, and Edge, but also some historical versions of these browsers. As it operates as a third-party system independent of the browser, browser upgrades will not affect users' normal usage. Following the removal of NPAPI support by mainstream browsers like Chrome in 2015 and PPAPI plugin support in 2022, Apemaster Office has emerged as the latest mature and commercially viable RTSP video streaming solution for web playback.
