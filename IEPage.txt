IE Control Embedded Web Applet: Developed based on the cross-browser native applet system - ApeMaster Middleware Network Premium Edition. The underlying layer calls the IE kernel's ActiveX control to achieve a programmatically driven dual-kernel browser.  
Compatible with Chrome 41, Firefox 50, Edge 80 (Chromium kernel), IE 8, Opera, Yandex, Electron, 360 Extreme/Security, Doubao, Quark, QQ, Sogou, Maxthon, Huawei, Lenovo, Liebao, Qizhi Trust, Red Lotus, dual-core, and other low-version browsers, also compatible with the latest versions of these browsers.  

1. Installation of ApeMaster Middleware:  
1) If it is an exe installer, please run it directly;  
2) If it is a portable package, decompress it to a disk directory and double-click "InstallWrl.bat" to install;  
3) Upon completion of installation, the ApeMaster middleware service will start, and the operation status will be output in the log file ZbaService.txt in the Data subdirectory of the installation directory.  

2. IE Control Applet Control Interfaces:  
Note: The following functions can be executed after connecting to the ApeMaster main service via Web Socket (ws://localhost:83?sid=12345&flag=1). If the default listening port is not 83 (refer to the document "ApeMaster Developer Manual.pdf" in the SDK package for configuring the listening port), specify the port number in the connection address.  
HTTP webpage online test: http://test.yuanmaster.com/iefull.html  
HTTPS webpage online test: https://test.yuanmaster.com/iepage.html  
If IE browser compatibility is required, replace the CLSID in the online test webpage:  
<object ID="WrlWS" CLASSID="CLSID:C0971B90-4513-4E2D-A0B6-15B915FE748A" width="0" height="0"></object>  
with: 21ADE2E6-B4DD-4F3E-8BD5-9DDAD1785F3A  
Front-end integration can refer to the above test webpages. The HTML webpage needs to embed code similar to the following:  
A. Mark the display position and size of the applet:  
.IEApplet {  
            margin: 20px 0 0 20px;  
            width: 480px;  
            height: 320px;  
            border: 1px solid blue;  
        }  
Or  
.IEApplet {  
            width: 480px;  
            height: 320px;  
            top: 20px;  
            left: 20px;  
            border: 1px solid blue;  
        }  
If the initial display position and size of the applet are not marked in the webpage Header area, add the following parameters in the JSON parameters when starting the applet:  
"Left":20,"Top":20,"Width":480,"Height":320  

B. Embed elements in the webpage:  
Supports IFrame:  
<iframe name="IEApplet" id="IEApplet" src="IEApplet3.html" frameborder="0" align="left" width="550" height="540" scrolling="no">  
Or directly use:  
<div id="IEApplet" class="IEApplet"></div>  

Additionally, embed the required JS scripts. The script programs are fully open source.  

1) Request to start the IE control applet to load IE kernel webpages locally in the webpage:  
Type is the browser type. Pass 0 for automatic judgment (prerequisite: the current browser is started and displayed in the foreground, Flag must be 0 when loading the current page). Can forcibly specify browser Type (1: IE, 2: Chrome, 4: Firefox, 5: Brave (English), 8: Opera, 9: Vivaldi (English), 10: Yandex, 16: Edge (Chromium kernel), 20: Electron, 32: 360 Extreme Browser, 33: 360 Security Browser, 34: 360 Extreme Browser, 35: 360 Enterprise Security Browser, 36: 360 Gaming Browser, 37: 360 AI Browser, 40: Lenovo Browser, 45: Dual-core Browser, 50: QQ Browser, 51: WeChat Webpage, 55: Qizhi Trust Browser, 57: Red Lotus Browser, 60: Sogou Browser, 61: Quark, 62: Maxthon Browser, 63: Liebao Browser, 66: Doubao, 70: Huawei Browser).  
When Type needs to specify the browser type, first use the interface Wrl_BrowserInfo in the TestWrl.txt document to obtain the current browser Type, main window handle BrowserWnd, drawing window handle DrawWnd, and current webpage title Title. Determine whether to continue starting by checking if Title matches the current webpage to be embedded. If continuing, set the obtained parameters Type, BrowserWnd, DrawWnd in the current request parameters to speed up startup.  
Title: Keyword in the webpage title.  
Url: The actual address of the webpage where the applet is loaded. Used to specify the display position and size of the applet in the webpage. Not recommended; use Web parameter instead.  
Flag mask mark: 1: Load in new tab (current page load if neither 1 nor 16 is specified), 2: Applet display window border, 4: Do not automatically clip out-of-bound windows, 8: Automatically adapt to webpage height and width display, 128: Anti-screenshot.  
Version: Specify the IE version to load. 0: Not specified. E.g., 9999: IE9 standard mode, 8888: IE8 standard mode, 8000: IE8 compatibility mode, 7000: IE7. Detailed definitions: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/internet-explorer/ie-developer/general-info/ee330730(v=vs.85)?redirectedfrom=MSDN#browser_emulation  
Web: Webpage configuration. Enables sharing Cookies between Chrome and other browsers' webpages and IE kernel webpages for automatic login. When Web is specified, the Url parameter is not needed. The display position and size of the applet must be set, corresponding to parameters Left, Top, Width, Height, etc.  
Option: 1: Start 64-bit version.  
Open: The URL address or local webpage address that needs to be opened with the IE kernel.  
IframeX and IframeY are the horizontal and vertical offset correction coordinates for iframe nesting.  
BarW and BarH are the reserved areas on the right and bottom of the webpage. ScrollTop is the reserved height for top scrolling.  
The actual display of the applet is first based on the coordinates and size specified in Url or Web, then corrected according to the values set in IframeX, IframeY, BarW, BarH.  
Note: Special characters in Open and Web such as =, &, double quotes, or Chinese must be URL-encoded before passing.  
Example:  
Automatically recognize the current browser and start at the specified position and size:  
{"req":"Wrl_IEPage","rid":2,"para":{"Type":"0","Title":"IE Applet","Flag":2,"Version":"0","Option":"0","IframeX":0,"IframeY":0,"BarW":0,"BarH":0,"ScrollTop":0,"Url": "http://local.zorrosoft.com/IEApplet.html","Open":"http://www.yuanmaster.com"}}  

Automatically recognize the current browser and start at the specified position and size (specify shared Cookie, no Url needed):  
{"req":"Wrl_IEPage","rid":2,"para":{"Type":"0","Title":"IE Applet","Flag":66,"Left":20,"Top":230,"Width":480,"Height":320,"Version":"0","Option":"0","Left":20,"Top":230,"Width":480,"Height":320,"IframeX":0,"IframeY":0,"BarW":0,"BarH":0,"ScrollTop":0,"Open":"http://www.yuanmaster.com","Web":"UID=zorro;Cur=2"}}
